An average coding geek with some new found passion for health and fitness.

### More Information

I have been working in the software engineering field since 2016. I had been always excited about programming from the first time I learned to code in `Q Basic` back in school.

In the recent times I have been interested in health and fitness. I have been experimenting and learning more about workouts and nutrition for about an year now.

I would like to use this blog to document my learnings and random thoughts on these subjects.

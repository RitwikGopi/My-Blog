<p>Let's start with setting up our machine first. First thing we need to do is make the local IP address of our machine static. You can see on the pictures above the IP address of my pi is <em>192.168.1.5 </em>this is assigned to it by router. In fact every time when our device gets disconnected from the router and gets reconnected, there is a pretty good chance that our device IP could change according to the number of other devices and order in which it get connected. First thing we need to do is make your IP static in your local network.</p>
<p>This step is going to be different depending up on routers. I will show you what I did in my router. My router is from D-Link. I believe this steps will be some what similar in all routers. First in your browser type the IP of your router. Typically it is 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1. If this doesn't work just go through google for "how to find my router IP" something like that.</p>
<p>Okay. Once you entered this address and hit go, you will be prompted to enter the username and password of your router. If you are logging in it for first time there is a good chance your default username and password is 'admin'. Enter your credentials and once you are in the control panel of your router, find a menu called LAN(Local Area Network). In that you can see a table named 'Static IP list' or something similar. In this what you have to do is enter the MAC Address of the machine on which you hosted your site, and assign a static IP for it. So that every time you connect your machine it will have same IP. A wise choice is to select a number after 50 or something. Suppose if chose something like 192.168.1.5 and if in our network there are some 10 devices, it is possible that other device might be assigned with this IP if our hosted device is not connected. So it's wise to choose a big number.</p>

<p>192.168.1.66 . That is the IP address I assigned for my raspberry pi. From now when ever my raspberry pi is connected to my router it will be assigned this IP address in my local network.</p>
